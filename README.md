PROBLEM STATEMENT
Problem Statement #2
Community Resilience Network
In the face of increasing climate-related disasters and other
emergency situations, building resilient communities is paramount.
We seek innovative solutions to develop a comprehensive
Community Resilience Network (CRN) - a digital platform designed
to empower communities in preparing for, responding to, and
recovering from disasters. Participants are tasked with designing and
developing a web and mobile application that fosters community
collaboration, provides critical information, and facilitates disaster
preparedness and response. The CRN should encompass the
following features:
Provide automated alerts and notifications for various types of
disasters, including weather-related events, natural disasters, and
emergencies, along with safety recommendations.
Develop a comprehensive directory of local resources, including
emergency shelters, medical facilities, and community support
organizations.
Allow users to report and track incidents, hazards, and emergencies
in real-time, with geolocation and multimedia capabilities.
Implement role-based access control for community members,
local authorities, and emergency responders, each with specific
permissions.
Bonus features: 
1. Ensure accessibility for diverse communities by offering multi-lingual support for content and communication.
2. Display incident reports on a map for better visualization of incident locations.
